## ASIC Design Overview
### A 10-minute presentation by Raiden H, with attached audio recordings

TODO:
- Integrated circuit overview
- ASIC Purpose
    - Hardware for specific use, rather than general-purpose
    - High efficiency compared to general-purpose
- Examples of usage
    - ASICs on motherboards
    - ASICs in GPUs (e.g. ML focused chips, Nvidia vs AMD ASICs)
    - System-on-Chip (SoC)
    - Packet switching (NoC)
    - Automotive computing
    - Cybersec
- Overview of different design types
    - Largely vary in granularity of custom components (fully predefined > fully custom hardware logic circuits) and programmability
